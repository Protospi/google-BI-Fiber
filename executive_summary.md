**Executive Summary**

This executive summary provides an overview of the end-of-course project completed for the Google Fiber customer service team. The project aimed to create a business intelligence (BI) dashboard to help the team understand customer support effectiveness, repeat caller trends in different markets, and the types of problems prompting repeat calls. This summary will highlight the project's goals, methods used, and the key functionalities of the BI dashboard.

**Project Goals:**

The primary objective of this project was to design and develop a BI dashboard that provides insights into customer support effectiveness for Google Fiber. The specific goals included:

1. Understanding the frequency of repeat calls after a customer's first inquiry to assess the effectiveness of first-contact resolution.

2. Identifying the types of customer issues that generate repeat calls to enable targeted improvements in customer support.

3. Exploring repeat caller trends in three different market cities to provide localized insights.

4. Designing charts that allow stakeholders to view trends on a weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual basis.

**Methods Used:**

To accomplish these goals, the following methods were employed:

1. **Data Preparation:** Data from multiple sources were collected and merged into a single reporting table. The data included information about customer support interactions, market-specific data, and call details.

2. **Tableau Integration:** The reporting table was loaded into Tableau for visualization. Tableau provided the flexibility to create interactive and informative charts and dashboards.

3. **Dashboard Design:** A low-fidelity mockup was created to plan the layout and components of the dashboard. Multiple mockups were developed to brainstorm the best way to present the data. The mockups served as a foundation for the final dashboard design.

4. **Chart Creation:** Multiple charts were created to address the project goals. Notable charts included bar charts depicting the number of repeat calls each month and the percentage of first-contact calls by day of the week. These charts allow stakeholders to gain insights into the frequency and timing of customer calls.

5. **Tabular Data:** Tables were integrated into the dashboard, providing stakeholders with detailed information. The tables included data on repeat calls by the first call date and calls categorized by market and problem type.

6. **Interactive Elements:** Filters, captions, and titles were added to enhance the interactivity of the dashboard. Users can filter data to view specific timeframes and market data, ensuring a more personalized and informative experience.

7. **Insightful Visualization:** The dashboard provided an intuitive and interactive platform for stakeholders to explore repeat caller trends across markets and problem types.

**Functionality of the Dashboard:**

The developed BI dashboard is divided into multiple tabs, each offering specific insights:

1. **Monthly Trends:** This tab features two bar charts. The first chart displays the number of repeat calls each month, allowing users to explore how often customers called again after their initial inquiry. The second chart visualizes the percentage of first contact calls by day of the week, helping stakeholders identify the busiest days for customer inquiries.

2. **Tabular Data:** The second tab includes two tables. The first table, "Repeat Calls by First Call Date," provides insights into the number of different types of calls by date. The second table, "Calls by Market and Type," offers a breakdown of calls by market and problem type, providing specific information about markets with high call volumes and the types of problems prompting repeat calls.

3. **Market-Specific Insights:** The third tab, "Market and Type for First Repeat Calls," utilizes data from the previous tab to visualize problem types generating the most repeat calls for different markets. This chart enables stakeholders to focus on addressing specific issues in particular markets.

4. **Quarterly Trends:** The final tab offers two charts, "Day 0 Calls by Market and Type Across Q1" and "First Repeat Call by Market and Type Across Q1," to gain insight into what markets and problems generate calls in the first quarter and which ones prompt customers to call again after the first contact.

In conclusion, this BI dashboard successfully addresses the project goals by providing Google Fiber's customer service team with valuable insights into customer support effectiveness, repeat caller trends, and the types of issues driving repeat calls. The interactive nature of the dashboard allows stakeholders to explore data in a personalized manner, making it a powerful tool for decision-making and improving customer support operations.

This project serves as an example of the skills and capabilities gained throughout the certificate program, demonstrating the ability to translate data into actionable insights. The completed dashboard and executive summary will be valuable additions to the portfolio, showcasing proficiency in business intelligence and data visualization to potential employers.
